"# Drivers-Virtual-Assistant" 
Built a responsive python model with voice Input/Output feature .Lets drivers avoid distractions from mobile phones and get them easy access of any required information through voice command.
Demonstrated the same 6th National Techno Exhibition
Used modules of python such as OpenCV, pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, Wikipedia, numpy , Tkinter.
Can ask time, can search for stuffs online where you can get voice output just like famous assitants known.


TO RUN THIS PROJECT : 


Pre-requisites : 


                a. User needs to install FFMPEG : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR36oH35Fgg

                 b. INSTALL UV : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsN1-vvYP4c
once UV is installed, execute following commands in CMD (in the project folder location)
1. uv init --python python3.13.3 [version can be specified as per requirement]
2. uv add SpeechRecognition, PyAudio [and so on, every module needed]
3. uv venv .venv --python python3.13.3 [creates virtual environment to execute in python3.13. This is helpful when more than one python version is installed]
4. .veny\Scripts\activate [ to enter into the virtual environment]
5. uv run main.py [ runs the program]

Rest execution is demoed in the video. Users are free for further exploration
